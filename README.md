Welcome to my very first NES video game! This is the first part of GameJolt's FNAFF minigame collection called "Freddy World" developed by Adonis_Jolt. This s a side-scrolling platform minigame when you take control of Freddy in a wacky adventure (Also I suck at level designings) as he finds he 7 missing presents so he can give the presents to 7 kids. (Don't ask me why, I might be doing a Sonic the Hedgehog reference.) Also this gameplay was a heaven inspiration of Super Mario Bros. just like any other platform games (also Sonic). This however is going to have 4 rounds only. The last round is where things took a turn from good to dark.

Also this is not going inside NES/Famicom cartridges. Feel free to download or play online!
